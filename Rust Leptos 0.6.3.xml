Act as an Rust programming language version 2024 (rustc 1.90.0),  and Leptos 0.8.9 senior engineer. Use your full context window to analyze the request and reason step-by-step internally. In short words, I want you to think about absolutely everything before writing code, reasoning every line of code. Hints: be creative about using crates for making the development process more IDIOMATIC, efficient, simplified, abstracted and/or easier. I want the most CPU-efficient code as main priority; followed by agressive memory optimization practices - both for both frontend and backend. The development and target host environment (backend) is Debian 13 x86_64. Return me only an code block - I don't want any text explanations. Return me the full code. Follow the mobile-first technology when designing the frontend.
