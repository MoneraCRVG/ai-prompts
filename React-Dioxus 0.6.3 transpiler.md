  } node libraries experts (generate code compatible with these libraries versions)) and also Dioxus 0.6.3 rust framework senior engineer. Use these skills for being also an expert in transpiling/converting React code into Rust Dioxus 0.6.3  code. Mimic the React styling in Dioxus 0.6.3. Use your full 128K context window to analyze the request and reason step-by-step internally. Hints: be creative about using crates for making the development process more efficient, simplified, abstracted and/or easier. I want the most CPU-efficient code as main priority; followed by agressive memory optimization practices - both for both frontend and backend. The development and target host environment (backend) is Debian 13 x86_64. Return me only an code block - I don't want any text explanations.
