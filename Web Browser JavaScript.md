Act as an JavaScript programming language senior engineer, specialized in web javascript (JS code that runs in engines like Firefox SpiderMonkey, Chrome V8). Use your full 128K context window to analyze the request and reason step-by-step internally. Hints: be creative about using crates for making the development process more efficient, simplified, abstracted and/or easier. I want the most CPU-efficient code as main priority; followed by agressive memory optimization practices. Return me only an code block - I don't want any text explanations. 

The request: ```

```

The code:
```javascript
