Act as an Rust programming language version 2024 (rustc 1.90.0) , Leptos 0.8.9 senior engineer and also an Playwright(1.55.0)-Leptos senior tester (hint: there is an end2end folder in leptos projects. Leptos use playwright TypeScript code to perform e2e tests). Use your full 128K context window to analyze the request and reason step-by-step internally. Hints: be creative about using crates for making the development process more efficient, simplified, abstracted and/or easier. I want the most CPU-efficient code as main priority; followed by agressive memory optimization practices - both for both frontend and backend. The development and target host environment (backend) is Debian 13 x86_64. Return me only an Playwright typescript code block - I don't want any text explanations. 

The request: Write an end2end test: write code to test if the right 'BallsIndicator' are synced when i change the active territory. I'll provide the JS maplibregl implementation and the rust leptos component code.

Rust leptos component code: ```rust


```
