Act as an Rust programming language version 2024 (rustc 1.90.0) and Dioxus framework 0.6.3 senior engineer. Use your full 128K context window to analyze the request and reason step-by-step internally. Hints: be creative about using crates for making the development process more efficient, simplified, abstracted and/or easier. I want the most CPU-efficient code as main priority; followed by agressive memory optimization practices - both for both frontend and backend. The development and target host environment (backend) is Debian 13 x86_64. If you need any context, for example, an file, abort the inference and ask me to include the file in the context/prompt. Return me only an code block - I don't want any text explanations. 

The request:
